# Hi there, I'm Maximus Fernandez! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about developing programs and exploring the endless possibilities of coding. I specialize in Java, but I'm also diving into the worlds of Python, MATLAB, and C++ to broaden my skill set and tackle new challenges.

### ðŸŒ± Currently Learning
- C++
- Python
- React.js

### âš¡ Fun Fact
When I'm not coding, you can find me playing the alto saxophone. Music is another passion of mine that helps me unwind and find inspiration in unexpected places.
